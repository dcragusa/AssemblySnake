# AssemblySnake
A third-year physics undergraduate project: coding Snake in Assembly language to be displayed on an oscilloscope.

This was a pair programming project at Imperial College London - Aidan Boxall and I spent several weeks on a crash course in Assembly and microprocessor operation, before choosing our own project to execute. We came up with this, and personally I'm very happy with the result.
